- NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO 1.0 DISCORD.PY AND FIXED SO IT FUCKIN WORKS.......

- ircbot extra info like ctcp version replies etc.
- configs should probably also be able to be changed and saved (actually dunno)
- make the default config file not have dumb shit in it
- callbacks from irc and discord to a wait_until_ready() thing on the adapter
