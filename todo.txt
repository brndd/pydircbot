- ircbot extra info like ctcp version replies etc.
- configs should probably also be able to be changed and saved
- make the default config file not have dumb shit in it
- callbacks from irc and discord to a wait_until_ready() thing on the adapter
- maybe provide an interactive console for the CLI? mite b cool...
- make IRC disconnect nicely (so we can provide a quit message)
